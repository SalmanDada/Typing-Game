## How I Made It:
* I have divided the game into two parts, First is setting bar and second one is main context.
* In setting bar, there is a option to select the difficulty of the game.
* I have created the button to function the setting bar. On the click of button it can hide the setting bar or show the setting bar.
* In main context, we have to type the given words which will generate randomly.
* I have used Math.random() to generate words randomly.
* If we didn't type the words in the given time, the game will end.
* I have created reload button to start the game again.
